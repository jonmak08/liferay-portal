                    <h6>I can't realte to lazy people. We don't speak the same language. I don't understand you. I don't want to understand you.</h6>

                <div class="paragraph">I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it.</div>
