## Module Directory Structure

When an application has multiple modules, the directory names for the modules
should always match the directory name of the application.

### Example

<<<<<<< HEAD
The directories of the modules inside the application
`\apps\collaboration\bookmarks` should all start with `bookmarks-`:
=======
The directories of the modules inside the application ```
\apps\collaboration\bookmarks``` should all start with
```bookmarks-```:
>>>>>>> compatible

* bookmarks-api
* bookmarks-service
* bookmarks-test
* bookmarks-web

---

<<<<<<< HEAD
A module directory name should not end with `-taglib-web`. Instead, it should
end with `-taglib`.
=======
